# Drawing Application

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PyQt5


## Additional Features

### layout

There is an advanced menu for certain brush properties which may be harder to understand.
The menu is hidden by the default and can be displayed by pressing a button.

### functional

Users are given to a second choice to enter a color by entering a HEX value into the added field. 

## Improvements

The user has a less bloated interface as advanced properties of the brush are hidden by default.
This makes it easier for new users to understand the app, but still gives the more advanced users
the option to customize things like cap and join type.
